Here are scenario-based interview questions and answers related to Amazon EC2 for a 3-year experienced DevOps engineer:

---

### **Q1: Your application is hosted on EC2 instances behind an Application Load Balancer (ALB). Users report intermittent connectivity issues. How would you troubleshoot the issue?**

**Answer:**
1. **Check ALB health checks:**
   - Verify that the target group health checks are properly configured.
   - Ensure health checks are passing for all instances. Adjust the health check configuration if needed (e.g., path, timeout, interval).

2. **Instance status:**
   - Verify the EC2 instance status checks (both system and instance checks).
   - Look for resource bottlenecks on the EC2 instances (CPU, memory, disk, etc.) using CloudWatch metrics.

3. **Security groups and network ACLs:**
   - Ensure that the security group allows traffic from the ALB to the instances.
   - Check for conflicting rules in network ACLs.

4. **Logs and monitoring:**
   - Review ALB access logs and CloudWatch metrics for unusual traffic patterns.
   - Check application logs for errors.

5. **Scaling issues:**
   - Confirm that auto-scaling is configured properly to handle varying traffic loads.
   - Adjust scaling policies if needed.

### **Q2: You have an EC2 instance running a critical application. The instance has stopped due to an underlying hardware failure. How would you handle this situation?**

**Answer:**
1. **Identify the failure:**
   - Check the EC2 instance status in the AWS Management Console to confirm the failure reason.

2. **Launch a replacement instance:**
   - If you are using an Elastic Load Balancer, traffic would have already been rerouted to healthy instances.
   - Launch a new EC2 instance from the latest AMI (Amazon Machine Image) or recover from a backup/snapshot.

3. **Attach storage:**
   - If the failed instance had EBS volumes, detach and reattach the volumes to the new instance.

4. **Update DNS if needed:**
   - If the instance had a static public IP, update the DNS record with the new instance's IP or associate an Elastic IP with the new instance.

5. **Implement preventive measures:**
   - Consider enabling EC2 Auto Recovery for similar instances in the future.
   - Use Auto Scaling groups with a minimum of one instance to ensure availability.

### **Q3: How would you configure EC2 instances to automatically install necessary packages and start a service on launch?**

**Answer:**
1. **Use User Data:**
   - Add a script in the user data field while launching the EC2 instance. Example for installing Apache and starting the service:
     ```bash
     #!/bin/bash
     yum update -y
     yum install -y httpd
     systemctl start httpd
     systemctl enable httpd
     ```
   - For Ubuntu, replace `yum` with `apt`.

2. **Use Configuration Management Tools:**
   - Use tools like Ansible, Chef, or Puppet for consistent configuration across multiple instances.

3. **Create a Custom AMI:**
   - Pre-configure an instance with the required packages and services, then create an AMI to launch new instances with the same setup.

### **Q4: You notice your EC2 instanceâ€™s disk is running out of space. How would you address this issue?**

**Answer:**
1. **Check Disk Usage:**
   - Use `df -h` and `du -sh /path` to identify which directories/files are consuming the most space.

2. **Clean Up:**
   - Remove unnecessary files, logs, or temporary files to free up space.

3. **Expand EBS Volume:**
   - In the AWS Console:
     - Stop the instance.
     - Increase the size of the attached EBS volume.
     - Restart the instance and resize the file system using `resize2fs` or `xfs_growfs`, depending on the file system.

4. **Enable Log Rotation:**
   - Configure logrotate to prevent logs from consuming excessive space.

5. **Move to S3:**
   - Migrate infrequently accessed data or logs to Amazon S3.

### **Q5: You are tasked with setting up an Auto Scaling group for your EC2 instances. How would you ensure smooth scaling with minimal downtime?**

**Answer:**
1. **Define the launch template/configuration:**
   - Include AMI ID, instance type, security groups, and user data scripts in the launch template.

2. **Set Auto Scaling policies:**
   - Use metrics like CPU utilization or request count to define scaling policies.
   - For example, scale out when CPU utilization > 70% and scale in when CPU utilization < 30%.

3. **Configure health checks:**
   - Enable both EC2 and ALB health checks to ensure unhealthy instances are replaced.

4. **Distribute traffic:**
   - Use an Application Load Balancer to distribute traffic across instances in the Auto Scaling group.

5. **Test scaling policies:**
   - Simulate traffic using tools like Apache JMeter or AWS Synthetics to validate scaling behavior.

6. **Use lifecycle hooks:**
   - Implement lifecycle hooks to perform custom actions (e.g., configuring instances before they enter the InService state).
